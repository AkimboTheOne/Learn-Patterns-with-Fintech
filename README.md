# Fintech Design Patterns Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of **creational design patterns** in the context of fintech applications using Java.

## 🎯 Purpose

The project implements 6 fundamental creational patterns applied to real-world use cases from the financial sector, demonstrating how these patterns solve common problems in financial software development.

## 🏗️ Implemented Patterns

### 1. 🏭 Factory Method Pattern
**Business Context:** Processing different types of financial transactions (credit card, wire transfer, crypto).

**Solution:** Decouples client code from concrete classes, enabling addition of new processors without modifying existing code.

**File:** `FactoryMethodPattern.java`

### 2. 🏭 Abstract Factory Pattern  
**Business Context:** Banking platform that renders UI components for both web and mobile applications, maintaining consistency across platforms.

**Solution:** Produces families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.

**File:** `AbstractFactoryPattern.java`

### 3. 🔒 Singleton Pattern
**Business Context:** Interest rate configuration shared across multiple modules (loans, savings, credit scoring).

**Solution:** Ensures a single instance of shared configuration, centralizes access and ensures consistency.

**File:** `SingletonPattern.java`

**Features:**
- Thread-safe using the Initialization-on-demand holder pattern
- Base rate and risk multiplier configuration
- Rate locking/unlocking system
- Automatic calculation of effective rates based on risk

### 4. 🔨 Builder Pattern
**Business Context:** Building complex mortgage application objects that require conditional collection of personal info, credit history, employment, etc.

**Solution:** Separates complex object construction from its representation, supporting flexible and step-by-step creation.

**File:** `BuilderPattern.java`

**Features:**
- Business rule validation
- Automatic loan-to-value (LTV) ratio calculation
- Eligibility assessment based on multiple criteria
- Flexible documentation support

### 5. 📋 Prototype Pattern
**Business Context:** Reuse of validated KYC profiles with small variations for new product registration.

**Solution:** Supports efficient duplication of objects without relying on constructors.

**File:** `PrototypePattern.java`

**Features:**
- Deep cloning of KYC profiles
- Template registry system
- Automatic profile validation
- Support for extensible additional data

### 6. 🏊‍♂️ Object Pool Pattern
**Business Context:** Trading engine that manages connections to external market APIs, maintaining a pool of reusable connections instead of constantly opening/closing them.

**Solution:** Optimizes performance and resource reuse by maintaining a pool of initialized objects.

**File:** `ObjectPoolPattern.java`

**Features:**
- Thread-safe pool with configurable timeout
- Pool statistics monitoring
- Automatic connection validation
- Management of expensive resource lifecycle

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle 8.2.1 or higher

### Build and Run
```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run demonstration of all patterns
./gradlew run

# Run directly from compiled classes
java -cp app/build/classes/java/main randomcode.App
```

### Run Individual Patterns
```bash
# Factory Method
java -cp app/build/classes/java/main randomcode.patterns.creational.FactoryMethodPattern

# Abstract Factory
java -cp app/build/classes/java/main randomcode.patterns.creational.AbstractFactoryPattern

# Singleton
java -cp app/build/classes/java/main randomcode.patterns.creational.SingletonPattern

# Builder
java -cp app/build/classes/java/main randomcode.patterns.creational.BuilderPattern

# Prototype
java -cp app/build/classes/java/main randomcode.patterns.creational.PrototypePattern

# Object Pool
java -cp app/build/classes/java/main randomcode.patterns.creational.ObjectPoolPattern
```

## 📊 Example Output

The main application demonstrates all patterns with detailed output including:

- **Factory Method:** Credit card transaction processing
- **Abstract Factory:** Mobile UI component rendering
- **Singleton:** Interest rate configuration management with locking
- **Builder:** Mortgage application construction with validation
- **Prototype:** KYC profile cloning for different use cases
- **Object Pool:** Market connection management with real-time statistics

## 📚 Fintech Use Cases

Each pattern solves real problems in financial applications:

1. **Multi-channel Processing:** Factory Method for different payment methods
2. **Cross-platform UI Consistency:** Abstract Factory for web/mobile
3. **Global Configuration:** Singleton for centralized interest rates
4. **Complex Forms:** Builder for credit applications
5. **Data Reuse:** Prototype for customer profiles
6. **Resource Optimization:** Object Pool for external connections

## 🔧 Extensibility

The design allows easy extension:
